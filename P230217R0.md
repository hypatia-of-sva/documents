# Introduction

This paper proposes two new statements, the labeled break and continue
statement, as well as a corresponding change in code generation, introducing
two label-like sequence points generated per scope which has a label on the
same line as the label inducing opening brace, which are only jumpable to
from within the scope. (In this sense, it might be called a "local" or "scoped goto".)

# Motivation and Scope



A longstanding goal of C++, and of higher level languages in general,
is the elimination of goto statements whereever possible. In this regard,
C++ could get rid of a whole lot of cases, in which C has to refer to goto+
statements, like "goto error" for error handling with exceptions (although
ther is still much debate about error handling, as exceptions are not always
the right tool depending on the domain).

However, there is one use of goto, that is necessary to this day in C++, and
that is the continuing of an outer loop within an inner loop without introducing
a flag variable. There might be a number of reasons, why a variable is not desired,
but the most obvious is code clarity. Examples are provided in the comparisons,
there it is also visible that they are useful for more than just loop continuation,
although that is the primary purpose of this proposal.

The primary point of comparison for this proposal is the named CYCLE and EXIT statment
of Fortran 90 and newer (cf. 8.1.4.4.3-4, p.99 of [@N692]). The statement
introduced here is broader, but should be compatible to it in order to facilitate translation
from fortran programs to C++.

The benefit is, that we don't expose labels to the compiler that could be called even from
outside the encompassing scope. This is a serious danger of a "break_outer" label, and is
not by defaut catchable by tooling, since a label indicates a manual change of control flow.
However, breaking or continuing a scope is in line with standard control flow and shouldn't break
it, this is fixed by standardizing these constructs in a uniform manner.

Because this is a low level language construct, it seems not a bad idea to coordingate this change
with a similar change of the C language in WG14, however, if this is not feasible, then C++ should
adopt this first and propose it to C later via SG22 or other means if possible.

# Design Overview

## Syntax

> |     `break` *identifier* `;`
> |     `continue` *identifier* `;`


## Model

Every labeled block

```cpp
label: {
  //...
}
```

shall be expanded to

```cpp
label: {
__BLOCK__BEGIN__label:
  //...
__BLOCK__LOOP__CONTINUE__label:
}
__BLOCK__END__label:
```

where `__BLOCK__BEGIN__label`, `__BLOCK__LOOP__CONTINUE__label` and `__BLOCK__END__label`
are compiler generated
labels inserted after the opening and closing curly brace, and are uniquely tied
to the label. In other words, for a block labeled `something_else: ` it would generate
the labels `__BLOCK__BEGIN__something_else` and `__BLOCK__END__something_else`.

The statement `break` *label* `;` shall be identical to
`goto __BLOCK_END__` *label* `;`.

The statement `continue` *label* `;` shall be identical to
`goto __BLOCK_BEGIN__` *label* `;` if the scope is not the body of an iteration statement,
and identical to `goto __BLOCK__LOOP__CONTINUE__` *label* `;` if it is.

The case differentiation makes the labeled `continue` statement behave like the ruglar `continue`
statement in loops, and treats each other scope like the body of an infinite loop. In this way, every
scope can be continued without changing the semantics for loops specifically.

Important: These labels are not accessible to the language user! They don't need to be named like
here specified. This model merely represents the way, these statments work, and a possible way
for them to be implemented.

The compiler needs to a) implement these statments, as if they were written with these `goto`'s,
and b) make sure that no other symbols but the label before the opening curly brace are exported
to the user.

## Constraints

The labeled `break` and `continue` statements are only to be used within the block enclosed
with the curly braces that match the beginning curly brace after the statement.

Any other use of these statements is a language error. A compiler must not allow them
in a compilation mode relating to strict standard compatibility (typically expressed
by compiletime options like `-pedantic`) and must give a diagnostics. Any implementation
that allows a `break` or `continue` statement out of scope is considered not standard
conform or is regarded as a non standard extension.

Also, all language implementation constraints of `goto` statements equally apply to the
labeled `break` and `continue` statements. (That is because they are implemented "as if"
they were goto statements, whether they are implemented with such a preprocessing step or not.)

# Proposed Wording

The following is the proposed change to the standard document, based on [@N4928].



Change __ยง8.7 [stmt.jump.general]__ by adding the last two options:


> | *jump-statement:*
> |     `break` `;`
> |     `continue` `;`
> |     `return` *expr-or-braced-init-list~opt~* `;`
> |     *coroutine-return-statement*
> |     `goto` *identifier* `;`
> |     `break` *identifier* `;`
> |     `continue` *identifier* `;`



Add new sections __ยง8.7 [stmt.break.block]__:

A scoped `break` statement shall be enclosed by a block scope with the same label
before the opening curly brace. It causes contol to pass to the first point after the corresponding
closing brace. More precisely, in the statement

```cpp
label: {
  //...
}
__BLOCK__END__label:
```

a `break label;` is equivalent to `goto __BLOCK__END__label;`.



And __ยง8.7 [stmt.continue.block]__:

A scoped `continue` statement shall be enclosed by a block scope with the same label
before the opening curly brace. It causes contol to pass to the first point after that opening
brace, or to the end of the scope, if the scope is a loop body, executing the equivalent control flow
as if a `continue` statement would be passed on that level of identation. More precisely, in the statement

```cpp
label: {
__BLOCK__BEGIN__label:
  //...
__BLOCK__LOOP__CONTINUE__label:
}
```

a `continue label;` is equivalent to `goto __BLOCK__BEGIN__label;`. if the scope is not the body of an iteration statement, and equivalent to `goto __BLOCK__LOOP__CONTINUE__label;` if it is.
